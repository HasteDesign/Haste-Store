** Requires WooCommerce to be installed. **

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't it work with my theme? =
The developer of the theme that you are using may have replaced the information (CSS classes) needed for this plugin to work. If theme developers do this, it is impossible to make this plugin work with every theme. WooCommerce Image Hover was built and tested on Storefront by Woo Themes to ensure it works with the standard WooCommerce CSS classes, maybe check out a Woo Theme for your site.

= How can I make it work with my theme? =
You could visit the Git repo and fork it and make as many changes as you need. Alternatively you can hire me to do it for you. :)
